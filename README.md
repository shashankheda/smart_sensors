This project about "Smart Wireless Sensors for Retail World" is aimed at making shelves smarter and digitally live. The wireless
sensor module developed is capable of tracking customer activity, shelf activity and store activity and is very
easily controlled and monitored remotely.

It uses simple components like nRF24L01+ transceiver (2.4 GHz), ATMEGA 328P-PU micro-controller and an IR Sensor Module
to facilitate effective and highly accurate data transmission (upto 30-40 meters without any external antenna) at a
very low cost.
